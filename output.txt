The part played by the cerebellum in higher cognitive func-
tions has been and remains something of an enigma.
Schmahmann and Caplan (2006) maintain that ‘‘The tradi-
tional teaching that the cerebellum is purely a motor control
device no longer appears valid, if, indeed, it ever was. There is
increasing recognition that the cerebellum contributes to
cognitive processing and emotional control in addition to its
role in motor coordination’’ (p. 290). On the contrary,
Glickstein (2006) in the same issue wrote: ‘‘Evidence for
a critical role for the cerebellum in cognition or emotion
remains unconvincing’’ (p. 289). Despite the fact that there is
a scientiﬁc journal ( The Cerebellum ) devoted solely to research
on the cerebellum, it appeared to us from discussion with
colleagues and others that recent developments in cerebellar
research are not widely known outside the ﬁeld of its prac-
tioners. We felt it was appropriate (70 years on from the well-
known paper by Holmes, 1939 ) to bring such research to the
attention of a wider audience involved in cognitive neurosci-
ence. We are grateful to the editors of Cortex for agreeing to our
suggestion to compile a special issue of the journal and to our
contributors for their papers.
In a letter dated 18th January, 1661 addressed to Robert Boyle,
Dr. Lower, assistant to the celebrated Thomas Willis, refers to
the latter’s ‘‘opinion of the use of the cerebellum for involuntary
motion’’, a view subsequently published in his famous text of
1664 (translated into English in 1681). Research on animals by
Luigi Rolando (1809) and Pierre Flourens (1824) in the early part
of the nineteenth century subsequently conﬁrmed that lesions
of the cerebellum produce severe disturbances of co-ordinated
movement. More fanciful ideas, however, were propagated by
the phrenologists. Franz Joseph Gall (see Gall et al., 1838,translated by Combe ) was of the view that the cerebellum was
the ‘‘organ of the instinct of reproduction’’. He drew a connec-
tion between the presumed size of the cerebellum and the
apparent propensity for enjoyment of sex, writing:
‘‘The lady of whom I have spoken above ( .) has a large and
beautiful head like a man, and she possesses distinguished
talents; but the nape of her neck has very little breadth
under the ears, which indicates a small development of the
cerebellum. I have hitherto found this conformation in all
persons in whom the instinct of reproduction was natu-
rally feeble’’ (p. 24).
Gall believed that there was a connection between the tes-
ticles and the cerebellum. As a direct test of Gall’s notion, the
ﬁnding of Franc ¸ois Leuret (1839) , referred to by Pierre Flourens
(1846 , translated by de Lucena Meigs), that on average the
cerebellum was larger in 21 geldings than in 10 stallions and 12
mares should have put paid once and for all to the idea that the
cerebellum had anything to do with the presence or size of
testicles but, being written in French, appears not to have been
read or simply ignored by later English speaking theorists. In
any case, it was apparently insufﬁcient to dispose of the idea
that the cerebellum was the seat of the amative instinct, an
idea which seems to have exercised a tenacious hold on the
Victorian imagination. As late as 1892, a follower of Gall, one
John William Taylor, wrote (p. 9):
‘‘(1) I am led to conclude, apart from co-ordination,
according to our leading cerebral physiologists, the main
function of the cerebellum is the amative instinct. (2) The

development of the cerebellum. (3) The loss of both testicles
by castration or otherwise causes a great diminution in the
bulk of the cerebellum; and (4) that excessive development
of the cerebellum predisposes to erotic mania.’’
Taylor (p. 9) quotes ‘‘David Ferrier, in Functions of the Brain ,
page 432’’ as follows: ‘‘As morbid irritation of the sexual
organs may excite a morbid sexual appetite, so, conversely,
the sexual appetite may be morbidly excited by pathological
irritation of the cerebral paths, and the cerebral centres of the
sensations connected with the exercise of generative func-
tions. To the former belong the satyriasis or nymphomania
occasionally observed in connection with the middle lobe of
the cerebellum; to the latter the various morbid exhibitions of
the sexual appetite in insanity, where the centres are func-
tionally or organically diseased’’.
Other than its supposed role in regard to the sexual
instinct, the idea that the cerebellum is involved in some way
in control of movement has a long history. The Greek anato-
mist Erasistratos (310–250 BC) was of the opinion that there
was a relation between the size of the cerebellum and the
running speed of animals (see Tesak and Code, 2008 , p. 7/8).
For a long time exploration of cerebellar function was
dominated by experimental work with animals. Luciani’s (1891)
descriptions of the effect of lesions to the cerebellum in dogs
and primates provided the basis for much that was to follow.
However, in a discussion of six contributions to a Symposium on
the Cerebellum published in volume 50 of Brain ,F r a n c i s Walshe
(1927) gave as his opinion that ‘‘the problem of cerebellar
functions remains where Luciani left it nearly half a century
ago’’ (p. 378) (for a modern evaluation of Luciani’s work see
Manni and Petrosini, 1997 ). Of the six papers of the symposium,
only one, by Theodore Weisenburg (later to publish a celebrated
work on aphasia), was based on clinical investigations in
humans rather than experimental work with animals.
Although not the only neurologist or physician to be inter-
ested in the cerebellum, it was the work of Holmes (1917, 1922)
more than anyone that encouraged clinical investigation of the
symptoms of cerebellar disease. One of the chief clinical signs
of acute cerebellar damage is what Holmes (1917) described in
his classic paper on the effects of gunshot wounds in 21 victims
of the ﬁrst world war as ‘decomposition of movement’. In this
paper, Holmes acknowledges his debt to ‘‘Babinski’s masterly
analysis of the symptoms of cerebellar disease’’ (p. 463).
Indeed, Babinski (1902) coined the term ‘adiadochokinesis’ to
refer to the inability to execute rapidly alternating movements.
He believed that the principal function of the cerebellum was
to link together simpler movements that make up compound
movements ( Babinski, 1899, 1906 ).
In the Tenth Hughlings Jackson Memorial Lecture delivered
in December 1938, Holmes (1939) began by pointing out that in
the 16 years since his 1922 Croonian lecture ‘‘numerous clin-
ical observations have been published and an enormous
amount of experimental work has been devoted to the cere-
bellum, but the conclusions drawn from them are so discor-
dant that it seems wiser to omit reference to them when
possible’’ (p. 1). His own conclusions were interesting in that
he dismissed the idea that the cerebellum contained a special
centre for co-ordination of movement. Rather, he argued that:‘‘.in addition to regulating postural tone, the cerebellum
reinforces or tunes up the cerebral motor apparatus,
including subcortical structures with motor functions, so
that they respond promptly to volitional stimuli and the
impulses from them which excite muscular contractions
are properly graded.
In his classical contributions to the physiology of the
cerebellum Luciani (1891) described as the three symptoms
of cerebellar defect: atonia [loss of muscle tone], astasia
[tremor, oscillation, inco-ordination] and asthenia
[muscular weakness]. These three symptoms occur in man
as a result of acute cerebellar lesions and by them the
irregularities of movement which constitute cerebellar
ataxia can be fully explained’’ (p. 29).
In the years following publication of the Hughlings Jackson
memorial lecture, research on the cerebellum moved apace.
Giuseppe Moruzzi and his colleagues demonstrated inhibitory
cerebellar inﬂuences on other parts of the brain, and partic-
ularly on the autonomic system ( Moruzzi, 1947 ). Sir Charles
Sherrington’s dictum that the cerebellum is the ‘‘head
ganglion of the proprioceptive system’’ ( Sherrington, 1906 )
emphasised that normal posture and movement requires
abundant proprioceptive input. Snider (1967) similarly
considered the cerebellum to be a regulator of sensory input,
while Brindley (1964) suggested that skills such as playing the
piano are ﬁrst learned consciously under cortical control but
with time and practice the cerebellum comes to control the
actions subconsciously or automatically.
Marr (1969) , well-known for his later contribution to the
study of vision, proposed that the cerebellum was important
both for learning movements and actions and for learning to
maintain balance and posture. Albus (1971) developed
a mathematical theory of cerebellar function independently of
Marr but saw it as an extension and modiﬁcation of the latter’s
theory. Albus regarded the cerebellum as being a site of motor
memory. De Schutter and Maex (1996) pointed out that along
with the ‘‘dogma’’ that the cerebellum is exclusively involved
in motor control, another has been that it is the site of memory
storage for motor learning as proposed by Marr and Albus,
a view De Schutter and Maex (1996) themselves rejected.
In reviewing non-motor functions of the cerebellum (as
revealed very largely by research on animals) Watson (1978)
concluded: ‘‘A large amount of evidence underscores the
insufﬁciency of strictly postural and motor control concepts.’’
He noted that through its connections with the forebrain,
reticular and limbic system structures, ‘‘The cerebellum may
contribute to sensory processing, learning, performance,
emotion, motivation and reward’’ (p. 960). Watson made no
mention of what we would consider cognition but a decade
later Leiner et al. (1989) reviewed ﬁndings on the human
cerebellum which led them to reject the view that this struc-
ture is exclusively involved in motor control (see also Leiner
et al., 1986 ). Instead they referred to ‘‘the cognitive cere-
bellum’’. They argued that the cerebellum is involved in
cognitive functions by virtue of the extensive connections
between it(especially the lateral cerebellar structures) and
frontal and prefrontal areas of the cortex. According to Leiner
et al. (1989) cerebellar connections to prefrontal cortex enable
the cerebellum to ‘‘improve’’ mental skills, connections tocortex 46 (2010) 811–820 812Broca’s area enable it to ‘‘improve’’ language skills and
connections to motor cortex enable the cerebellum to
‘‘improve’’ motor skills.
From time to time the view had been expressed prior to
publication of the paper by Leiner et al. (1989) that the cere-
bellum was involved in cognitive functions (e.g., Gowers, 1888 )
but usually dismissed (e.g., Andre ´-Thomas, 1912 ). Controversy
over the role of the cerebellum, what it does and how it does it,
has characterised cerebellar research since at least the nine-
teenth century and has continued to do so. Weisenburg (1927)
began his paper with the words ‘‘Perhaps there is no subject in
neurology today about which there is more controversy than
the function of the cerebellum’’. Almost 50 years later in an
attempt to extend the diversity of possible lesion locations in
foreign accent syndrome beyond the supratentorial brain
regions, Cole (1971) discussed two patients in whom the
causative lesion was situated in the posterior fossa. Robert
Joynt, former editor-in-chief of Neurology , commented on this
unexpected ﬁnding: ‘‘ .it doesn’t appear unusual that any of
the brain mechanisms which are used to integrate motor acts
may alter force, prosody, and rhythm of speech. It is well that
Dr. Cole has pointed this out with posterior fossa lesions’’ (p.
153). However, he ironically added: ‘‘( .) I am enough of
a romanticist to think that these subtle inﬂections and
nuances of speech must ultimately stem from the cerebral
cortex. For example, if Juliet had said in a monotone, ‘‘Romeo,
Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo?’’ I doubt if Romeo would
have done himself in for her. But then, I don’t think Shake-
speare wrote for the cerebellum.’’ (p. 153).
A quarter of a century later, the role of the cerebellum in
non-motor functions was still being questioned. The April
26th, 1996 issue of Science has an introductory article entitled
‘‘The Cerebellum: Movement coordinator or much more?’’.
Ten years after that an invited commentary ( Glickstein, 2006 )
on a paper in Brain (Ravizza et al., 2006 ) appears under the
heading ‘‘The Cerebellum – motor control or more?’’ while
Glickstein (2007) asks the rhetorical question ‘‘What does the
cerebellum really do?’’ In these papers Glickstein takes issue
with the emerging view that the cerebellum has a role to play
in cognitive and linguistic functions.
In some ways it is not surprising that there remains
controversy regarding the role of the cerebellum in cognitive
functions. It is a relatively small structure at the bottom of the
brain that seems to hide under the occipital lobes as if unwilling
to assume a more prominent position in the cranial cavity. Yet
the cerebellum contains at least as many neurones than the
much larger cerebrum under which it lies. As Glickstein (1993)
put it, ‘‘The cerebellar hemispheres have more cells than the
cerebral cortex. What on earth do they do?’’ (p. 451).
In a much cited paper, Schmahmann and Sherman (1998)
studied 20 patients with disease conﬁned to the cerebellum,
concluding that there is a constellation of deﬁcits which they
termed the ‘‘cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome’’ char-
acterised by disturbances of executive, linguistic, spatial and
affective function. Not all deﬁcits occurred in each case but
certain symptoms were particularly prominent. Decreased
verbal ﬂuency was said to be present in 18 patients and visuo-
spatial ‘‘disintegration’’ in 19 cases. However, the authors
pointed out that ‘‘it is impossible on the basis of these cases to
distinguish the contribution of the lesioned cerebellum tothese abnormal behaviours from that of the cerebral regions
newly deprived of their connections with the cerebellum.
Furthermore, (.) disruption of behaviour by cerebellar lesions
is, to some extent, transient’’ (p. 576).
In an earlier paper reviewing cognitive, psychiatric and
other aspects of research on the cerebellum, Schmahmann
(1991) suggested that ‘‘The overshoot and inability in the
motor system to check parameters of movement may ( .)b e
equated, in the cognitive realm, with a mismatch between
reality and perceived reality, and erratic attempts to correct
the errors of thought or behavior. Hence, perhaps, dysmetria
of thought’’ (p. 1183).
As with other cerebral structures (see Thach, 1996 ), claims
that the cerebellum has a role to play in cognition or linguistic
function derive from three main strands of research: ﬁrst, the
effect of cerebral lesions, second functional neuroimaging
studies and third, neuroanatomical considerations. To these
might be added investigations of developmental abnormalities
of the cerebellum (for general critique and review of cerebellar
research in relation to cognition see Stein and Glickstein, 1992;
Thach et al., 1992; Leiner et al., 1993; Daum and Ackermann,
1995; Thach, 1996; Paquier and Marie ¨n, 2005; Timmann and
Daum, 2007; Strick et al., 2009 ). Special issues of Trends in
Cognitive Science (Volume 2, issue 9, 1998) and the companion
volume Trends in Neurosciences (Volume 21, issue 9, 1998) as well
as Volume 13, issues 2–3 (2006) of the Journal of Neurolinguistics
and Volume 59, issue 4 (2007) of Folia Phoniatrica et Logopaedica
are devoted to the cerebellum. March 2002 saw the ﬁrst issue of
The Cerebellum , a quarterly journal devoted to the science of the
cerebellum and its role in ataxia and other disorders. For
a review speciﬁcally of executive function in relation to the
cerebellum see Bellebaum and Daum (2007) and for spatial
processing and the cerebellum see Molinari and Leggio (2007) .
Reviews of the role of the cerebellum in language functions are
provided byGordon (1996) ,Marie ¨n et al. (2001b) ,Paquier and
Marie ¨n (2005), De Smet et al. (2007b) , and Murdoch (2010, this
issue) . For brief review of history of anatomical research see
Glickstein, Strata and Voogd (2009) .
Glickstein (2006, 2007; Glickstein and Doron, 2008 ) is one of
the most sceptical opponents of the view that the cerebellum
is involved in cognition (for an explicitly contrary opinion to
that of Glickstein see Strick et al., 2009 ). The main thrusts of
his arguments are that evaluation of the effects of cerebral
lesions is difﬁcult since ‘‘Lesions of the cerebellum may not
occur in isolation. Traumatic, vascular, developmental
anomalies and tumours typically cause damage to brain
structures outside of the cerebellum and treatments associ-
ated with cerebellar resection, such as chemotherapy and
radiation, may themselves produce cognitive deﬁcits’’ (p. 288).
With regard to neuroimaging research, Glickstein (2007; see
also Glickstein and Doron, 2008 ) suggests activation of cere-
bellar areas may be related to actual or planned movement of
the eyes, vocal apparatus or ﬁngers rather than to cognition,
a view buttressed by the fact that neuroanatomical connec-
tions between cerebellum and cortex largely involve areas
concerned with eye movements as opposed to areas known to
be involved in cognition.
Seventy years on from publication of Holmes’s (1939)
landmark paper we are pleased to have the opportunity to
bring together for readers of this journal a collection of reviewcortex 46 (2010) 811–820 813articles and reports devoted to current research carried out in
to the functions of the cerebellum, together with the associ-
ated controversies. One of us (AB) is not directly concerned
with cerebellar research but was drawn to consider its func-
tions by an interest in dyslexia and the hypothesis ( Fawcett
and Nicolson, 1992; Nicolson et al., 1995, 2001; Nicolson and
Fawcett, 2007 ) that a cerebellar deﬁcit is at the root of this
developmental condition (for critiques see Beaton, 2002,
2004a; Vlachos et al., 2007 ; see also Bishop, 2002 ). In addi-
tion, this co-editor among others ( Peters, 1995; Snyder et al.,
1995; McManus and Cornish, 1997; Ja ¨ncke et al., 1999 ) has
suggested that the phenomenon of handedness is intimately
associated with the functions of the cerebellum ( Beaton, 2003,
2004b ), a view lent credence perhaps by the ﬁnding that
cerebellar damage results in impairment of skilful move-
ments of the ﬁngers ( Glickstein et al., 2005 ). In addition, left
and right hands differ in terms of their ‘‘steadiness’’ ( Simon,
1964; Annett et al., 1979 ), or lack of extraneous movement in
performing ﬁne motor tasks, and in the degree to which each
is associated with cerebellar activation ( Ja¨ncke et al., 1999 ).
Furthermore, cerebellar volume is related to measures of ﬁne
motor dexterity ( Paradiso et al., 1997 ). The second co-editor
(PM) has been much more intimately involved in research on
the cerebellum for a number of years ( Baillieux et al., 2006,
2007; De Smet et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2009; Marie ¨n et al., 1996,
2000, 2001a, 2001b, 2006, 2007, 2009; Marie ¨n and Verhoeven,
2007; Paquier and Marie ¨n, 2005 ).
As we see it, there are three main issues relating to the
question ‘‘Does the cerebellum contribute to cognitive and
linguistic functions and, if so, how?’’
1. Does the cerebellum have a single modus
vivendi or does it operate in a multiplicity of
ways?
A number of authors have proposed that the cerebellum
operates according to some single principle or is dedicated to
a relatively restricted set of functions. Bloedel (1992) was
struck by the functional heterogeneity of the cerebellum in
the face of its structural homogeneity. According to Bloedel,
‘‘cerebellar function involves a characteristic operation that is
performed across its various components. ( .) this operation
includes integrating sensory information about execution
space, the target, peripheral inputs, and the body scheme with
inputs reﬂecting the properties of the movement being
executed. Although the fundamental characteristics of this
operation are likely to be similar across the subdivisions of the
cerebellum, the organization of cerebellar afferent and
efferent systems will result in differences in the behavioral
consequences of the processing in various cerebellar regions.
This heterogeneity reﬂects the multiple systems with which
the cerebellum interacts rather than a multiplicity of func-
tional operations within the cerebellum itself’’ (p. 678).
As noted above, Snider (1967) thought the role of the
cerebellum is to modulate sensory input. More recently, Gao
et al. (1996) suggested that the cerebellum is specialised
more for acquisition of sensory data than for movement per
se. They argued that ‘‘cerebellar deﬁcits in voluntary move-
ment, such as incoordination and ataxia, may reﬂectdisruption of the sensory data (from the medial cerebellum-
controlled muscle spindle system) on which the motor
system depends, rather than disruption of cerebellar compu-
tations of smooth motor performance per se’’ (p. 547).
The concept of ‘‘‘control augmentation’, based on the
computer action of cerebellar circuits’’ was proposed by Ito
(1986) . He regarded the cerebellum ( Ito, 1990 ) as ‘‘an organ
dedicated to endow adaptive control abilities to all kinds of
bodily functions, through reﬂexes to voluntary movement to
mental activity’’ (p. 569) and pointed out that ‘‘Dysmetria can
be regarded as impairment of predictive control, for which
a computer is indispensable. Incoordination may be related to
multivariable control in which plural inputs and outputs are
manipulated at the same time’’ (p. 564). Through a process of
error learning the cerebellum develops and updates internal
models of the dynamics of body parts which allow perfor-
mance of precise movements without the need to refer to
feedback from the moving part. This applies to manipulation
of mental representations of the cerebral cortex as much as to
adaptive control of motor activity ( Ito, 1993, 2008 ). This kind of
view has much in common with others that see the cere-
bellum as essentially a predictive device ( Miall et al., 1993;
Courchesne and Allen, 1997 ).
One role for the cerebellum that has been emphasised, in
particular by Ivry and his colleagues, is that of timing ( Ivry and
Keele, 1989; Ivry, 1993; Ivry and Fiez, 2000 ). A problem in
timing the temporal relation between antagonist muscles
would explain the dysmetria and adiadochokinesia that is
seen following cerebellar damage although ‘‘The timing
functions of the cerebellum are not limited to motor control’’
(Ivry et al., 2002 , p. 304).
Raymond et al. (1996) agreed with Marr (1969) and Albus
(1971) that ‘‘the idea that the cerebellum is a primary site of
motor learning ( .) is one of the most appealing hypotheses of
cerebellar function’’. On the basis of similarity of neural
mechanisms used in eye-blink conditioning and learning in
relation to the vestibulo-ocular reﬂex (VOR), both of which are
cerebellum-dependent, they suggested that the cerebellum is
a ‘‘neuronal learning machine’’. Such learning is seen, for
example, in prism adaptation experiments. Raymond et al.
(1996) suggest that the neural mechanisms used in these
two behaviours may ‘‘represent general principles that apply
to all forms of cerebellum-dependent learning, including
motor learning in saccadic eye movements and reaching arm
movements’’ (p. 130).
Schmahmann (2004) argues that ‘‘because cerebellar
anatomy is essentially uniform throughout the structure, the
basic work that the cerebellum does in the nervous system
should be constant as well. This we have referred to as the
universal cerebellar transform, characterized as the cerebellar
modulation of behaviour, serving as an oscillation dampener
maintaining function automatically around a homeostatic
baseline and smoothing out performance in all domains’’
(p. 374–5).
One way in which the cerebellum might inﬂuence different
cognitive functions in brain damaged patients is through the
inﬂuence of diaschisis. A number of studies have shown that
damage to the cerebellum can lead to reduced metabolic
activity in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere (see e.g.,
Botez et al., 1990; So ¨nmezoglu et al., 1993; Marie ¨n et al., 1996 )cortex 46 (2010) 811–820 814and elsewhere due, perhaps, to the loss of excitatory cere-
bellar input to thalamus and forebrain structures, that is, to
a reverse cerebellar diaschisis ( Anderson et al., 1988 ). The
opposite effect can also occur (diminished activity in the
contralateral cerebellum as a result of a cerebral infarction) as
found, for example, in studies by Baron et al. (1981), Broich
et al. (1987), Marie ¨n et al. (2006) and Marie ¨n and Verhoeven
(2007) .
Crossed cerebellar diaschisis was not seen in three cases
with lesions restricted to the parieto-occipital region in a PET
study by Martin and Raichle (1983) although they noted that
cerebellar hypometabolism was a general ﬁnding in their
patients with cerebral infarction. Cerebellar asymmetry of
metabolism was seen in every one of their patients with
frontal lobe lesions, the side of lowest metabolism being
contralateral to the cerebral lesion in all six cases. In another
study of 43 patients ( Metter et al., 1987 ) crossed cerebellar
diaschisis was found to occur in all eight cases of Broca’s
aphasia. The level of motor disability (functioning of arm and
leg) in cases where there was a cerebellar asymmetry in
glucose metabolism was greater than when there was no such
asymmetry.
Even in the absence of brain damage there may be a close
correspondence between activity in certain areas of one
cerebral hemisphere and activity in the opposite cerebellar
hemisphere. In a PET study carried out with young normal
adults to address this possibility a signiﬁcant inverse corre-
lation was found between relative left–right asymmetry of
glucose metabolism in frontal cortex and relative asymmetry
of activation in the cerebellum ( Junck et al., 1988 ).
It seems to us self-evident that the putative role of the
cerebellum as applied to cognitive functions cannot be
considered in isolation from concurrent supratentorial
activity. Indeed, the concept of a functionally ‘‘lateralised’’
cognitive ( Allin et al., 2001; Gottwald et al., 2004; Hokkanen
et al., 2006 ) and linguistic cerebellum ( Marie ¨n et al., 2001b ;
Jansen et al., 2005; Stoodley and Schmahmann, 2009a ), which
is becoming increasingly accepted by researchers, is predi-
cated upon the importance of the crossed connections
between cerebellum and cerebral cortex.
2. Extent of movement artefact in fMRI
studies (and how interpreted)
One problem in interpreting the results of fMRI studies is that
rarely does one have full experimental control over what
a participant is thinking. Decety et al. (1990) showed that the
cerebellum is activated along with the frontal cortex when
subjects merely imagine making tennis movements or count
silently. These authors suggested that the cerebellum there-
fore ‘‘participates in pure mental activity’’ and ‘‘may be
involved in motor programming which precedes motor acts’’
(p. 316). (They also suggested that it possibly plays a role in the
temporal organisation of neural events related to cognition).
Similarly, instructions to participants simply to imagine
producing speech are sufﬁcient to induce activation in the
cerebellum ( Ackermann et al., 1998 ). Since experimental
protocols require participants at some point to initiate anovert spoken or manual act, merely thinking of it can intro-
duce the possibility of unwanted activation.
It has been argued by some that language deﬁcits seen in
patients with cerebellar disease or injury concern purely the
motor aspects of speech although it is difﬁcult to conceive of
what motor deﬁcits could produce symptoms such as anomia
(Akshoomoff et al., 1992 ) or agrammatism that have been
reported. For example, Silveri et al. (1994) described the case of
a man who sustained a right cerebellar infarct. This patient
was said not to be aphasic in his native Italian language, nor to
show any syntactic defect; rather he exhibited an impairment
in the use of uninﬂected verbs and in the use of clitics
amounting to an agrammatism. Similarly, Marie ¨n et al. (1996 ,
2000) described the case of a patient with an ischaemic
infarction in the vascular territory of the right superior cere-
bellar artery who developed aphasic symptoms, including
‘‘full-blown agrammatism’’.
A patient with right cerebellar damage reported by Fiez
et al. (1992) was asked to generate a verb in response to
a visually presented noun. He tended to provide an unusually
high number of non-verb responses (e.g., ‘‘sharp’’ in response
to ‘‘razor’’ where control subjects gave ‘‘shave’’) without
realising that his responses were in any way abnormal (but
seeRichter et al., 2004 ). He produced a large number of errors
on other word generation tasks, namely synonym, category
and attribute generation. The patient was impaired at select-
ing a synonym from two alternatives and in almost all tasks
he failed to show the normal improvement with practice seen
in the control subjects. It is difﬁcult to see how this pattern of
results can be brought about by purely motor impairment.
Conversely, the (right lateral inferior) cerebellum has been
shown to be active in response to participants being asked to
generate a verb to a given noun after subtraction of a repeti-
tion condition in which the noun was repeated (see Petersen
and Fiez, 1993 ).Leiner et al. (1993) argued that such ﬁndings
demonstrate that the cerebellum cannot have a purely motor
function, as traditionally thought, but participates in cognitive
operations.
Nor is it easy to conceive how motor deﬁcits can explain
impaired cognitive associative learning in cerebellar patients
(see Timmann et al., 2002, 2004 ) although slowed or inefﬁcient
motor function arguably might contribute to impairment on
certain attentional (see e.g., Gottwald et al., 2003 ) or visuo-
spatial tasks (see e.g., Bracke-Tolkmitt et al., 1989;
Akshoomoff et al., 1992; Molinari and Leggio, 2007 ). Of
course, a strict differentiation between cognitive and motor
functions cannot be sustained ( Bloedel, 1993 ). Most action or
movement is made in the service of some end and in relation
to an existing cognitive framework.
3. Localisation within the cerebellum
The ﬁrst serious attempt at localisation within the cerebellum
was apparently that of Bolk (1906) who concluded that there
was some degree of functional localisation in motor control
(see also Manni and Petrosini, 2004 ).Holmes (1917) discussed
the question of localisation of function but came to no deﬁnite
conclusion: ‘‘But though my observations lend no support to
the theory of focal localisation of function in the cerebellarcortex 46 (2010) 811–820 815cortex they cannot be accepted as proof that such localization
does not exist’’ (p. 534).
On the basis of studies of over 50 patients with cerebellar
lesions Weisenburg (1927 ; see also Mills and Weisenburg,
1914 ) came down ﬁrmly in favour of localisation. He
concluded: ‘‘In the vermis are represented the synergic
activities of the trunk; in the superior vermis the movements
of the shoulder–girdle or the upper trunk; in the inferior ver-
mis the pelvic–girdle or lower trunk. Synergic control of the
limbs is in the lateral hemispheres, for the upper limbs in the
superior portion, for the lower in the inferior’’ (p. 376).
In their classic papers describing the results of ablation and
stimulation in the cat, Chambers and Sprague (1955a, 1955b)
argued that the cerebellum is longitudinally organised into
two functional zones. The medial zone consists of the vermal
cortex and fastigial nuclei; the intermediate zone of paravermal
cortex and interpositus nuclei. They pointed out that the attri-
butes of each zone correspond to the categories of motor func-
tion known as pyramidal and extra-pyramidal respectively.
This ‘‘zonal’’ characterisation of the functions of the cerebellum
stood in contrast to the concept of ‘‘lobular’’ organisation.
Schmahmann (2004, 2007) argued from clinical investiga-
tions that while the anterior lobe of the cerebellum is largely
concerned with motor control, the cerebellar vermis is
involved in emotional processing and the posterior lobe in
cognitive processing. More recently, Stoodley and
Schmahmann (2009b) carried out a meta-analysis of pub-
lished neuroimaging studies in healthy participants (see also
Schoch et al., 2006 for a large scale study). Their results sug-
gested that sensori-motor tasks engaged lobule 5 (along with
V1 and VIII) of the anterior lobe and that ‘‘language, working
memory and spatial processing were largely localized to
lobules V1, Crus 1 and Crus 11. Emotional processing included
a midline peak in lobule V11At, and hemispheric activation
peaks in lobules V1 and Crus 1. Executive functions showed
a distributed pattern, and included bilateral regions in lobule
V1, Crus 1, and V11B’’ (p. 496).
The question of a possible involvement of the cerebellum
in cognitive and affective processes has been overshadowed
for more than a century by research interest in the motor role
of the cerebellum. However, recent advances in elucidating
the neuroanatomical connections of the cerebellum with the
supratentorial regions that subserve cognition, combined
with evidence from functional neuroimaging, neurophysio-
logical and neuropsychological research, have extended the
view of the cerebellum from that of a simple co-ordinator of
autonomic and somatic motor function. Yet despite the
considerable effort currently devoted to investigating non-
motor functions of the cerebellum we do not understand the
precise nature of these functions. To do so will require
continued investigation of the anatomy and physiology of this
structure, together with behavioural and clinical studies of the
effects of cerebellar lesions in patients and theoretically
driven experimental and neuroimaging investigations with
healthy volunteers. Each of these different methodologies and
approaches is represented in the papers included in this
special issue. As well as providing new data, the collection of
papers includes a number of review articles which we believe
will be of interest to readers of Cortex , especially those for
whom this area of research is relatively unfamiliar.In the ﬁrst paper of the special issue Cantalupo and
Hopkins (2010, this issue) place the development of the
human cerebellum within a comparative and evolutionary
framework. They point out that great apes show relatively
greater size of the cerebellum, especially of the lateral neo-
cerebellum known to be involved in planning of reaching
and visually guided movements, than do monkeys. Cantalupo
and Hopkins (2010, this issue) present data relating cerebellar
size and asymmetry in the chimpanzee to evolutionarily
signiﬁcant behaviours, namely tool use and aimed throwing,
and show that handedness (or armedness) for throwing is
related to asymmetry in volume of the cerebellum.
In the next paper, Stoodley and Schmahmann (2010, this
issue) analyse anatomical, functional neuroimaging, and
clinical data to test the hypothesis of a topographic organi-
sation of the human cerebellum. Evidence is presented that
supports a regional organisation of motor, cognitive, and
limbic behaviours. The authors consider this functional
topography of the cerebellum to be a consequence of the
differential arrangement of connections of the cerebellum
with the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebral hemispheres,
reﬂecting cerebellar incorporation into the distributed neural
circuits subserving movement, cognition, and emotion.
Timmann et al. (2010, this issue) compare the results of
human cerebellar lesion studies investigating associative
learning in the motor, emotional and cognitive domain. The
authors show that such studies provide evidence for a role of
the cerebellum in motor, emotional and cognitive associative
learning. Given its simple and homogeneous micro-circuitry,
the authors hypothesise that a common computation may
underly cerebellar involvement in these different forms of
associative learning and that the overall task of the cere-
bellum may be to provide correct predictions about the rela-
tionship between sensory stimuli.
In his paper Murdoch (2010, this issue) critically reviews
the neuroanatomical, clinical and functional neuroimaging
evidence suggestive of a crucial role for the cerebellum in
various aspects of language processing. The possible neuro-
pathophysiological substrates of language impairment asso-
ciated with cerebellar pathology are discussed and the nature
of the linguistic deﬁcits associated with disease or damage to
the cerebellum are described.
Baillieux et al. (2010, this issue) explore the neuro-
psychological deﬁcits seen in a group of 18 patients with
vascular ( n¼13) and neoplastic ( n¼5) lesions of the cere-
bellum. They report ﬁnding a wide range of deﬁcits in language,
attention, executive function and memory which they relate to
lateralised modulation of cognitive functions through the
mechanism of crossed cerebello-cerebral diaschisis.
The interaction between the cerebellum and the neo-cortex
in regard to executive function and working memory is
explored in the contribution by Marvel and Desmond (2010, this
issue) . Their fMRI ﬁndings add to existing data that suggest
a functional and anatomical dissociation between dorsal
(motor) and ventral (cognitive) regions within the dentate
nucleus. Durisko and Fiez (2010, this issue) also examine
working memory using fMRI, distinguishing between regions of
the cerebellum involved in overt and covert speech tasks on the
one hand and verbal working memory tasks on the other. These
two papers indicate the complexity of the problem thatcortex 46 (2010) 811–820 816confronts us in attempting to understand how different cere-
bellar regions contribute to performance on different experi-
mental tasks.
To investigate the inﬂuence of structural anomalies on
cognitive, linguistic and emotional development, Tavano and
Borgatti (2010, this issue) compared the neurobehavioural
proﬁles of children with Joubert syndrome and children with
malformationsconﬁned to the cerebellar vermisand one or both
cerebellar hemispheres. The overall evidence provides support
for an important role of cerebellar structures per se in shaping
emotional, cognitive and linguistic development, when vermian
lesions are associated with cerebellar hemispheric lesions.
Lesions restricted to cerebellar vermis and brainstem, by
comparison, appear to have a major impact on motor-related
skills, includingoro-motor abilities and verbal working memory.
On the basis of a comparative study, Davis et al. (2010, this
issue) show that children who receive treatment early in life
for a cerebellar tumour are likely to suffer adverse development
of both cognitive and motor ability. Type of tumour/treatment
and age at diagnosis were found to be the most reliable
predictors of subsequent outcome. Catsman-Berrevoets and
Aarsen (2010, this issue) analysed the spectrum of behavioural
abnormalities, speech and language characteristics in a cohort
of 41 children with the posterior fossa syndrome following
cerebellar tumour surgery. During recovery all children were
dysarthric, but only a few patients presented speech features
speciﬁc to cerebellar dysarthria. A signiﬁcant correlation was
found between duration of mutism and severity of neurological
symptoms. Signiﬁcant correlations were also found between
duration of mutism and abnormalities on SPECT.
It is clear from the papers in this special issue that the role of
the cerebellum remains something of an enigma and there is
much yet to learn. The Belgian artist Igor Verpoorten hints at
this in the artwork on the cover of this special issue, evoking
a dark-sided, cerebellar part of the brain, the functions of which
remain to be fully elucidated. It is our hope that the papers we
have gathered together will not only stimulate further research
into the role of this mysterious organ but help to reﬁne the
experimental approaches and methodological controls
required to do so. Unfortunately, not all the individuals we
contacted were able to accept our invitation to contribute within
the time frame available, given their other commitments, but
we trust that, likeus, they would have been pleased to havebeen
associated with the ﬁnal collection of papers we have assem-
bled. These include not only the papers in the current issue but
a number of review papers. The latter cover functional local-
isation in the cerebellum ( Glickstein et al., in press ), cognitive
repercussions of hereditary cerebellar disorders ( Manto and
Lorivel, in press ), the cerebellum and dyslexia ( Stoodley and
Stein, in press ), developmental disorders more generally
(Nicolson and Fawcett, in press ), cerebellar involvement in
associative learning ( Bellebaum and Daum, in press ), and the
sequencing hypothesis of cerebellar function ( Leggio et al., in
press ). The review papers will appear in the January 2011 issue
ofCortex , and will provide a forum for discussion.
We wish again to thank all our invited contributors for
their manuscripts and for bearing patiently with us in the
sometimes protracted matter of editing and revising their
papers. We also wish to thank our long suffering referees
without whom we could not have produced this special issue.As often happens, referees did not always agree with each
other, nor we with them, and we were sometimes obliged to
steer a middle course between competing opinions. We hope
that in so doing we have not unduly offended any academic
sensibilities. Finally, we wish to express our gratitude to the
editorial assistants at the Cortex ofﬁce, Mrs. Cheryl Phillips,
Mr. Oliver Stewart and Dr. Laura Valkonen who willingly gave
of their time and expertise in many ways, not least in helping
us to navigate (with a greater or lesser degree of success) the
vagaries of the on-line submission system!
